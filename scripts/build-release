# Run make distcheck-fast.
#
#    This actually builds the tarball, unpacks the tarball, builds it
#    out of tree, runs a short set of tests against it, does a local
#    make install, followed by make uninstall, and makes sure no
#    debris is left around.  This runs configure with all default
#    arguments, so it is testing dynamically linked executables.
#
#    The particular tests it runs are:
#
#    - Conformance tests all non-translated non-simplified PPD files
#      and distinct global ones.
#
#    - Runs test-rastertogutenprint on distinct printers, with fast
#      options (minimum paper size, lowest resolution, very fast
#      dithering).
#
#    - Runs run-testpattern-2:
#
#      + Distinct printers, fast options
#
#      + Selected printers, with cross product of input mode (and bit
#        depth), color correction, ink type, and use gloss.
#
#    It also has the property of maybe updating the .po files.  These
#    will later need to be committed and included in the tag.  So we
#    have to do our check for uncommitted bits prior to this.
#
#    It has not escaped me that this could be part of a CI testing
#    process.  I don't know if Sourceforge has the necessary gittage
#    (as GitHub does) to allow a merge bot to run something like this
#    and only merge to the main repository if this suite passes.
#
#    The reason for the distcheck-fast is so that if something stupid
#    goes wrong it gets caught quickly.  It takes about 270 seconmds
#    on my laptop.  It would be Kind Of Annoying to spend hours
#    testing only to find out that something's not handling destdir
#    correctly or make clean isn't removing something.
#
#    Note that this can't be combined with valgrind, since this builds
#    dynamic executables which can't conveniently be valground since
#    they're actually shell scripts.
#
#    There's now an even faster check, distcheck-minimal, that only
#    tests a handful of printers.  It takes about 50 seconds to run.
#    But that's really most useful for testing the distcheck
#    apparatus.
#
# So far we're at just over 5 minutes on a Skylake Xeon E3-1505Mv5,
# which isn't too bad for a prerelease smoke test.  The rest of this

# combinations with a few printers, all using fast options.  It
# uses both CUPS and run-testpattern-2 testing.  However, it's
# essentially embarrassingly parallel.
#
# I'd like not to go too long without running it, as it's easy for
