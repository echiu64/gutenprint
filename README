INTRODUCTION

    This is Gutenprint version 5.0.0 release candidate 1, the first
    release candidate of Gutenprint 5.0.  Gutenprint, formerly named
    Gimp-Print, is a suite of printer drivers that may be used with
    most common UNIX print spooling systems, including CUPS, lpr,
    LPRng, or others.  These drivers provide high quality printing for
    UNIX (including Macintosh OS X 10.2 and newer) and Linux systems
    in many cases equal to or better than proprietary vendor-supplied
    drivers, and can be used for many of the most demanding printing
    tasks.  A complete list of supported printers may be found in the
    NEWS file.

    The package has been renamed in order to clearly distinguish it
    from the GIMP.  While this package started out as the Print plugin
    for the GIMP, it has expanded into a collection of general purpose
    printer drivers, and the Print plugin for the GIMP is now only a
    small (but important) piece of the package.  Furthermore, the name
    Gutenprint recognizes Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the
    movable type printing press.  Finally, the word "guten" means
    "good" in German.

    Gutenprint also includes a plug-in for the GIMP image editor.
    This plug-in is also distributed with the GIMP.

    Gutenprint was previously known as Gimp-Print.  The name was
    changed prior to the 5.0.0 release.

    Please read this README, and the NEWS file carefully!  Many things
    have changed from previous releases.  The package is quite
    different in many ways from Gimp-Print 4.2, and you should read
    these instructions carefully.  In addition, the NEWS file contains
    specific software requirements.

    A user's manual exists in doc/users_guide; it is normally
    installed in PDF and HTML form in /usr/local/share/gutenprint/doc.
    This manual covers setup and use of the GIMP Print plug-in and the
    CUPS driver.

    We urge all distributors of this package to read the PACKAGING and
    KNOWN BUILD ISSUES section below.


BASIC INSTALLATION

    Gutenprint includes the following primary components:

      - The core driver, libgutenprint.so
      - A user's manual
      - A Print plug-in for the GIMP
      - A CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) driver
      - An IJS-based Ghostscript driver
      - Support for the Foomatic spooler configuration system
      - A utility to administer Epson printers, escputil

    By default, Gutenprint builds the Print plugin for the GIMP, the
    user's manual, and a utility to perform head cleaning, nozzle
    alignment, and other tasks on EPSON Stylus inkjet printers, named
    "escputil".  Directions for building other components are listed
    below.

    Please check our web site at http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net for
    details about what is and is not supported.

    Please report any problems to gimp-print-devel@sourceforge.net.

    In general, to build Gutenprint, you run the following commands:

    ./configure [options]
    make
    make install

    If you do not have the GIMP installed (or if you have only the
    user package installed, and not the development package that most
    distributions include separately), the attempt to run configure
    will fail.  To build other components (such as the Ghostscript or
    CUPS drivers) without the GIMP being present, you must use the
    --without-gimp option to configure.

    By default dynamically loadable modules (plug-ins) will be built,
    and loaded at run-time if your operating system supports it.  If
    you experience problems, --with-modules=dlopen or
    --with-modules=ltdl may be used to select the module loading
    method (dlopen is the default, but GNU libltdl is more portable),
    or --with-modules=static or --without-modules disables them.

    Note: This package requires the use of GNU Make to compile.  On
    systems with both GNU make and another make installed, GNU make
    may be named `gmake' or `gnumake'.  BSD users in particular will
    need to use 'gmake'.


THE GIMP

    Gutenprint may be used as a plug-in for the GIMP, providing the
    ability to print images.  If you wish to do so, you must use the
    GIMP 1.2.3 or above on the 1.2 line, or any GIMP 2.x release (2.0,
    2.1, 2.2, etc.)  Please read the release notes in addition to this
    README, as there have been some changes in procedure since
    Gimp-Print 4.2 if you are using certain versions of the GIMP.

    To build and install the GIMP Print plug-in for the GIMP 1.2:

    ./configure [--with-gimp]
    make
    make install

    For the GIMP 2.0 or above, the option "--with-gimp2" rather than
    "--with-gimp" should be used.

    You may optionally specify --with-gimp or --with-gimp2 if you wish
    to be explicit about building the GIMP Print plugin; --with-gimp
    is implied if `configure' detects that the GIMP is installed, so
    you do not actually need to specify it.

    This installs the GIMP Print plugin in your system plug-in
    directory.  If you wish to install it in your personal plugin
    directory, you may use

    ./configure --enable-user-install

    If you have installed the GIMP as a precompiled package
    (e. g. from an RPM), you will need to install the gimp-devel
    (sometimes called gimp-developer, or something similar) package as
    well as the gimp package.  The GIMP package as supplied in most
    distributions only contains what's needed to run the GIMP, not the
    additional files needed to build GIMP-based applications and
    plugins such as the Print plugin.  On some systems, you will also
    need to install gtk-devel and glib-devel packages as well.

    If you have installed the GIMP from source on Linux: after running
    make install, you must run ldconfig as root before attempting to
    build this plugin.

    The GIMP 1.2 will not be supported in Gutenprint 5.1 and beyond.
    However, all Gutenprint 5.0 releases will support The GIMP 1.2.

    The GIMP 2.x plugin may eventually be migrated to The GIMP project
    for a future GIMP release.  It may be removed from the Gutenprint
    distribution following Gutenprint 5.0.


CUPS

    Gutenprint may be used as a driver under CUPS (Common UNIX
    Printing System), if your system uses that spooler.  Full
    description of CUPS is beyond the scope of this README file; full
    information may be found at http://www.cups.org.  Gutenprint 5.0
    requires CUPS 1.1.9 or higher.  We recommend use of 1.1.15 or
    above; that release of CUPS fixes some important bugs.

    This package includes a CUPS driver that may be built, allowing
    use of this software for general printing purposes.  To build and
    install the CUPS driver, you must run:

    ./configure --with-cups
    make
    make install
    cups-genppdupdate.5.0 (OPTIONAL)
    /etc/init.d/cups restart

    If you have installed CUPS as a precompiled package (e. g. it's
    the standard printing system that your distribution uses), you may
    need to install a separate development package (typically called
    "cups-devel" or "cups-developer").  You will need to do this if
    configure completes correctly, but "make" fails when building in
    src/cups.  The CUPS package typically installed by most
    distributions only contains the components needed to run CUPS, not
    those required to build additional CUPS drivers.

    The last command (/etc/init.d/cups restart) varies with your
    operating system; the purpose is to restart the CUPS server
    (daemon) so that it sees the newly installed driver.  It is
    typically /etc/init.d/cups, /etc/software/init.d/cups,
    /etc/rc.d/cups, or even /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups.  Your system may
    have a different way to restart the CUPS server.  OS X uses the
    following command:

    sudo /System/Library/StartupItems/PrintingServices/PrintingServices.sh restart
  
    You may optionally choose to update your existing PPD files using
    the command cups-genppdupdate.5.0, after which you should restart
    CUPS as described above.  We strongly recommend use of this update
    procedure.  This script will automatically update Gutenprint PPD
    files from earlier versions.  This script will only work with
    Gimp-Print 4.3.21 or above, or any earlier version of Gutenprint;
    it will not update Gimp-Print 4.2 PPD files.  However, you may
    install Gutenprint 5.0 alongside Gimp-Print 4.2, and use both
    Gimp-Print 4.2 and Gutenprint 5.0 drivers concurrently.
    Therefore, you need not convert a workflow based on Gimp-Print 4.2
    right away, but can gradually convert or even use both drivers for
    different printer queues.

    If you do not choose to automatically update existing PPD files,
    you should reinstall any printers that you are using Gutenprint
    PPD files with.  The Gutenprint driver and the PPD files must be
    kept in sync, since the PPD files reflect the particular version
    of the driver that they were built against.  If you attempt to use
    a version of Gutenprint with PPD files not built for that precise
    version, the driver will fail with a diagnostic error message.
    For example, PPD files built for Gutenprint 5.0.0-beta4 will not
    work with driver version 5.0.0-rc1.  You can identify printers
    using Gutenprint PPD files by the name of the PPD file, which will
    be something like:

		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0-rc1(en)

    NOTE for Linux (at least) users: If you are using CUPS 1.1.11 or
    higher, and you have a USB-connected printer, you must have a
    printer connected to each USB port that you plan to use and
    powered on when you restart CUPS.  If you do not do so, you will
    not be able to reinstall the printer.  It is only necessary to do
    this if you wish to update PPD files manually; if you use
    cups-genppdupdate.5.0, you do not need to do this.

    Starting with CUPS 1.1.11, you cannot choose an AppSocket
    connection and enter "usb:/dev/usblp0" or the like as the URI; you
    will get a "client-error-not-possible" error at the end of the
    installation process, and you will have a message like the
    following in your CUPS error log (typically
    /var/log/cups/error_log):

E [21/Nov/2001:17:59:07 +0500] add_printer: bad device-uri attribute 'usb:/dev/usb/lp0'!

    If the printer was turned on correctly, you will be given a choice
    of a USB connection in the Device dialog.

    You may also have problems if you have a .lpoptions file that has
    old options set.  If you have problems printing, please remove any
    existing .lpoptions file in your home directory and try printing
    again.

    This package normally builds translated versions of the PPD
    files.  This provides PPD files translated into the languages that
    this package supports.  However, the translation process does not
    work correctly on all systems; in particular, many BSD systems are
    known to simply build multiple copies of the English PPD files.
    If your system does not build these files correctly, which will be
    apparent when you use a CUPS front end to select a PPD file and
    you see something like this:

		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0-rc1(en)
		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0-rc1(en)
		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0-rc1(en)

    rather than this:

		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0-rc1(en)
		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0-rc1(sv)
		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.0-rc1(fr)

    you may wish to turn off the translation of PPD files:

    ./configure --with-cups --disable-translated-cups-ppds

    You may also wish to do this to greatly reduce the number of PPD
    files installed on your system, as the number of translations is
    large and growing.

    The PPD files associated with this driver are normally for Level 3
    PostScript.  CUPS versions starting with 1.1.15 fully implement
    Level 3 Postscript, but earlier versions do not implement a few
    Level 3 constructs.  The configuration script will attempt to
    detect the version of CUPS and generate appropriate PPD files.  If
    you wish to build PPD files for Level 2 Postscript even with a
    newer version of CUPS, you can run

    ./configure --with-cups --disable-cups-level3-ppds

    We recommend that all users who wish to use this package for
    general purpose printing install either CUPS or use Foomatic with
    the Ghostscript driver (both described below) and use that as
    their printing system, rather than the traditional lpd or lp
    systems.  It is much simpler to manage than lpd, and provides an
    excellent web-based interface for both administration and use.
    Please visit http://www.cups.org for information on downloading
    and installing CUPS.


FOOMATIC

    Gutenprint includes support for the Foomatic meta-driver package.
    This requires the foomatic-xml distribution.  Foomatic is
    available from http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html.  The
    first version of Foomatic (the one used with Gimp-Print 4.0) is
    not compatible with Gutenprint 5.0.  Note that the Foomatic driver
    was named `stp' in Gimp-Print 4.0; in Gimp-Print 4.2 (and early
    4.3) it was named `gimp-print' for the Ghostscript ("stp") driver
    and "gimp-print-ijs" for the IJS driver.  In 5.0 only the
    "gutenprint-ijs" data is present.  The data for the Gimp-Print 4.2
    driver is not compatible with the 5.0 driver.

    Furthermore, as of Gutenprint 5.0 the Foomatic driver will include
    the release version of Gutenprint in its name.  Therefore, the
    Foomatic name for this driver is "gutenprint-ijs.5.0".

    Foomatic data generation has been fixed as of Gutenprint
    5.0.0-beta4, and is now an appropriate solution for queue
    configuration.

    To verify that you have an appropriate version of Foomatic, please
    run

    foomatic-kitload

    or

    /usr/local/sbin/foomatic-kitload (if /usr/local/sbin is not on your PATH).

    Both Foomatic 2.0.x (old stable branch) and 3.0 (current stable
    branch) are supported.  With Foomatic 3.0 there are the extra
    features of heaving an additional "PrintoutMode" option with
    pre-configurations for common printing tasks and the options being
    put into different groups ("General", "PrintoutMode",
    "Adjustment").

    If you don't have Foomatic installed, or the version that is
    installed is too old, please download the current Foomatic 3.0x
    package from

    http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/foomatic/foomatic-current.tar.gz

    and follow the instructions in that package. See

    After Foomatic is installed, build the Foomatic data as follows:

    ./configure --with-foomatic
    make
    make install

    The "make install" step will add the necessary data to your
    Foomatic installation.  It must be run as root.  It will fail if
    Foomatic is not installed or your Foomatic is too old.  Now you
    can either set up a queue for your printer with
    "foomatic-configure" (see USAGE file in the Foomatic package) or
    generate the printer description file for your spooler (with
    "foomatic-datafile") and configure your printer as described on
    the spooler-specific web pages of linuxprinting.org.

    IMPORTANT: Whenever you install a new version of Gutenprint you
    must re-create the printer queues using Gutenprint with Foomatic
    (these queues have a driver name of "gutenprint-ijs.5.0").

    Note that it almost never makes sense to build the Foomatic driver
    without also building the Ghostscript driver, even if Foomatic is
    to be used with CUPS (CUPS-O-Matic).  Please read the instructions
    below in the GHOSTSCRIPT section.

    If you do not wish to build the Gimp Print plugin, you must run

    ./configure --with-foomatic --without-gimp

    or

    ./configure --with-ghostscript --with-foomatic --without-gimp

    Please visit http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html for more
    information on Foomatic.

    Foomatic provides an alternate interface to CUPS, in addition to
    an interface to LPD, LPRng, GNUlpr, PDQ, PPR, CPS, and spooler-less
    printing.


GHOSTSCRIPT

    Gutenprint includes an IJS-based Ghostscript driver.  As
    paraphrased from the Ghostscript documentation, IJS is a
    relatively new initiative to improve the quality and ease of use
    of inkjet printing with Ghostscript.  Using IJS, one can add new
    drivers, or upgrade existing ones, without recompiling
    Ghostscript.  IJS drivers run as separate processes that
    communicate with Ghostscript via an IPC channel.  As the basic IJS
    implementation is licensed compatibly with the GPL, and as the
    driver runs in a separate process from Ghostscript itself, the IJS
    driver may be used with AFPL Ghostscript (7.04 and above).

    The basic way to build the Ghostscript driver is

    ./configure --with-ghostscript [--without-gimp]
    make
    make install

    You must have the IJS libraries installed for this to work.
    Instructions for that are included with GNU Ghostscript 6.53 and
    beyond, AFPL Ghostscript 7.04 and beyond, and ESP Ghostscript 7.05
    and beyond.

    We strongly recommend that end users not use this driver directly.
    The available options are very complex and are subject to change,
    and the standard printer configuration tools (such as apsfilter
    and magicfilter) do not provide a convenient interface to the
    driver's capabilities.  We recommend that end users either install
    CUPS, as described above, or use Foomatic to configure printer
    queues, as described above.  We no longer provide documentation on
    manual use of this driver.

    Gutenprint 5.0 no longer provides the monolithic "stp" driver
    present in 4.2.  This driver, which was linked directly into
    Ghostscript, was very difficult to maintain and required a complex
    integration procedure.


RECOMMENDED SETTINGS

    We recommend starting with all default settings for the color
    settings.  The settings can be adjusted as necessary for
    particular combinations of ink, paper, and subject material.

    On most inkjet printers, using plain or coated inkjet paper, 600
    or 720 dpi will produce high quality; 1200x1200 or 1440x720 dpi
    will produce extremely high quality.  On newer printers with very
    small drops, or when printing photographs to special photo paper,
    higher resolutions such as 2880x1440 DPI may be required to
    achieve the highest quality.

KNOWN BUILD/INSTALLATION ISSUES

    This section describes a number of issues that have been
    encountered while building or installing Gutenprint.  If any of
    these apply to you, please read the notes carefully.  The issues
    are:

    1) Building escputil may fail, or escputil may fail to run.

    2) CUPS PPD files may not be translated (there may be multiple
       versions of the PPD files, all in English).

    3) Build/installation of Foomatic data may happen correctly, but
       the generated PPD files do not work correctly.

    Detailed descriptions of these issues follow.

    * There is a known complication building "escputil" that causes
      problems on some systems.  "escputil" uses the "readline"
      package, to support command editing and history within the
      program.  Unfortunately, linking programs with "readline" often
      requires linking against additional libraries, and the exact
      library depends upon the system (e. g. not all Linux systems
      have the same requirements).

      The configure script attempts to determine which additional
      library must be linked against.  It tries using the following
      libraries in this order to build a test executable:

      -lncurses
      -lcurses
      -ltermcap
      no additional libraries

      The reason it tries other libraries first is that some systems
      will link successfully, but only fail when an attempt is made to
      actually call readline.  Therefore, we assume that additional
      libraries are required.  Since we try the extra libraries in
      order from most recent to oldest, we expect that the first one
      we find will be appropriate.  For example, if the "ncurses"
      library is the standard on a given system, the "termcap" library
      may be provided for back compatibility, but it is unlikely that
      "termcap" will be the standard with "curses" or "ncurses" being
      provided for compatibility only (so that the link will succeed
      but the command will use the incorrect library).

      As this procedure is not failsafe, we provide the following
      configure options to control this behavior:

      ./configure --with-readline=yes  (the default; attempts to
				       determine the correct library
				       to link against)

      ./configure --with-readline=no   (turns off use of readline
				       altogether)

      ./configure --with-readline=only (specifically instructs
				       configure to not attempt to
				       link against any other
				       libraries)

      ./configure --with-readline=libs (specifies the libraries to be
				       linked against)

      An hypothetical (this won't work anywhere!) example of the
      latter would be

      ./configure --with-readline='-lncurses -ltermcap'

      Note that configure will not allow readline to be used if it
      cannot successfully build the test program, regardless of the
      option selected.  If you are having difficulty getting escputil
      to build, we suggest using --with-readline=no.  The commands
      used within escputil are very short and seldom require
      significant editing.

    * There is a known translation problem building the PPD files used
      by the CUPS driver such that on many systems all of the PPD
      files are in the English language.  This causes CUPS tools, such
      as KUPS or http://localhost:631 to display many copies of each
      PPD file, all in the English (en) language.  In fact, the PPD
      files should be translated into Swedish, Polish, Norwegian,
      French, Danish, Spanish, Slovakian, Greek, British English,
      Dutch, German, and Portuguese.  With CUPS 1.1.10 and lower,
      there should be two copies of the (en) PPD file, and one copy
      each of (sv), (no), (fr), (pl), (da), (sk), (el), (es), (nl),
      (de), and (pt).  With CUPS 1.1.11 and above, there should be
      (en), (en_GB), (sv), (no), (fr), (pl), (da), (sk), (el), (es),
      (nl), (de), and (pt) PPD files.

      The PPD files are created by a program named "genppd" in the
      src/cups directory.  This program is called once for each
      language, and creates all of the PPD files for the language in
      one shot.

      The command 'zgrep' can be used to determine if genppd is
      creating the PPD files correctly, as follows:

	  src/cups$ zgrep LanguageVersion ppd/*/pcl-4.ppd.gz
	  ppd/C/pcl-4.ppd.gz:*LanguageVersion: English
	  ppd/da/pcl-4.ppd.gz:*LanguageVersion: Danish
	  ppd/en_GB/pcl-4.ppd.gz:*LanguageVersion: English-GB
	  ...

      If the PPD file for each language has a different language
      version, the genppd program operated correctly.  If instead the
      output looks like this:

	  src/cups$ zgrep LanguageVersion ppd/*/stp-pcl-4.5.0.ppd.gz
	  ppd/C/stp-pcl-4.5.0.ppd.gz:*LanguageVersion: English
	  ppd/da/stp-pcl-4.5.0.ppd.gz:*LanguageVersion: English
	  ppd/en_GB/stp-pcl-4.5.0.ppd.gz:*LanguageVersion: English
	  ...

      the program did not operate correctly.

      If you do not have 'zgrep' on your system, you can gunzip the
      PPD files, and use

	  grep LanguageVersion ppd/*/stp-pcl-4.5.0.ppd

      to accomplish the same test.

      The normal mechanism for performing translations is to set the
      LANG environment variable to the appropriate language prior to
      running the program.  This normally causes the program to search
      the translations (normally in /usr/share/locale or
      /usr/lib/locale) for the chosen language.  When a specially
      marked string is used, a special macro calls `gettext()' on the
      string to retrieve the translation, and substitutes the
      translation for the string in question.

      There are two problems with this approach in the context of
      genppd.  The translation engine is intended to be used after
      installation, not during build, and this causes problems.

      1) At the time genppd is run, the translations have not been
         installed in the normal system directories.  Fortunately,
         it's possible to tell the translation machinery (via
         bindtextdomain) to look elsewhere for the translation
         catalogs.  What we do is install the catalogs in a temporary
         directory under src/cups, and tell genppd to instruct the
         translation machinery to look there.  This workaround is
         straightforward, and doesn't normally cause problems.

      2) LANG only lets us pick a valid locale (normally determined by
         listing the directories in /usr/share/locale or
         /usr/lib/locale).  Unfortunately, while language codes (which
         form the base of locales) are standard, the actual locale
         names aren't always.  On some systems, the locale names are
         just the language base names; on others, they are the
         language names concatenated with country codes (e. g. en_US),
         while on others they are language codes concatenated with
         character sets.  We are not aware of any workaround for this,
         possibly short of actually running make install and then
         rebuilding the PPD's.  'make install' will install the
         message catalogs, and that may create the necessary locale
         directories.  This is not exactly a very elegant approach.

      The GNU gettext library (libintl.a) provides another environment
      variable, LANGUAGE, which unconditionally looks up translations
      according to the language, ignoring LANG and the LC_*
      environment variables that are normally used for translation.
      This library is no longer included with Gutenprint
      (--with-included-gettext will not work).  Install the GNU
      gettext package first if you need libintl.a.  Many systems
      provide translation machinery in their standard libraries, and
      it may not always be best to use foreign libraries to replace
      standard system functionality.

      We have chosen to use LANGUAGE for this purpose, as the GNU
      gettext library appears to offer the most reliable translation,
      and LANGUAGE appears to offer the most reliable mechanism.  We
      have actually found that LANG and LC_* can interfere with
      LANGUAGE, thus we do not use both.

      To determine if the translations are working, you must actually
      inspect the PPD files.  You will need to

      cd src/cups/ppd/sv
      gunzip *
      more *

      or the like to determine if this is successful.  In particular,
      look for LanguageVersion, and make sure that it is correct (it
      should be "Swedish" in the sv directory, for example), and also
      make sure that the paper sizes are also translated.  We
      currently suggest using the Swedish translation for this purpose
      as it is the most complete.

      If packagers find that the PPD files are all in English, rather
      than translated into the appropriate languages, we suggest the
      following:

      1) Install GNU gettext (libintl).  If your system is not based
         on GNU libc (Linux usually is based on GNU libc; BSD,
         Solaris, IRIX, etc. are not), you will need this to have any
         possibility of creating the translated PPD files.

      2) Run 'make install' to install the package (including the
         message catalogs) onto the system first, and then do the
         following:

	 cd src/cups
	 rm ppd-stamp
	 make

	 to rebuild the PPD files.  Having the message catalogs on the
	 system may permit this to succeed.

      3) Ensure that your system actually has locales named 'sv',
         'pl', and all of the other supported languages, and change
         LANGUAGE to something more appropriate (most likely LANG,
         LC_MESSAGES, or LC_ALL).

      4) Build the PPD files on a Linux-based system; they are
         portable.

      5) Use --disable-translated-cups-ppds on the configure command line
         to suppress the translated PPD files altogether.

      Please feel free to contact us about this issue.

    * There are multiple issues that one must be aware of when using
      Foomatic with Gutenprint.

      1) Before installing Gutenprint 5.0.0-rc1, you must manually
	 remove any existing Foomatic option files.  This is because the
	 Foomatic utility to load data kits (foomatic-kitload) does not
	 remove obsolete data files from the Foomatic database.  If you
	 do not do this, any PPD files you generate will be incorrect
	 and printing may work incorrectly or not at all.

	 Foomatic option files are usually located in 

	 /usr/local/share/foomatic/db/source/opt

	 or

	 /usr/share/foomatic/db/source/opt

	 Assuming they're in the former location, you must remove data
	 files associated with the Gutenprint driver.  The command to do
	 this, which must be run as the superuser (root) is

	 cd /usr/local/share/foomatic/db/source/opt
	 ls -l gutenprint-ijs*.xml

	 If there are existing files present, you must remove them:

	 rm -f gutenprint-ijs*.xml

	 Now check to make sure that they are gone:

	 ls -l gutenprint-ijs*.xml

	 CAUTION: Be very careful when typing this command!  Minor
	 errors in typing these commands may result in severe damage to
	 your system.

	 After this, you may run 'make install' in your Gutenprint
	 source directory to install the package.  You will then need to
	 re-create any printer queues using Foomatic.

	 In general, you will have to perform this procedure any time
	 you install a new version of Gutenprint.

	 Please check the Foomatic site
	 (http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html) and the Gutenprint
	 site (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net) for updated
	 instructions about this.

      2) Unlike with the CUPS native driver, there is no simple way to
	 update all PPD files when you install a new version of
	 Gutenprint.  You must either use the foomatic-ppdfile command
	 to upgrade PPD files individually, or foomatic-compiledb to
	 build all PPD files.

         From this point forward, the Foomatic data will be version
	 locked to the Gutenprint release installed on the system.  For
	 example, PPD files generated with the Foomatic data for this
	 release will not work with the ijsgutenprint in the next
	 release.  This is to prevent accidentally using incorrect
	 data, which could cause incorrect function to take place.


PACKAGING

    We recommend that packagers and distributors of Gutenprint use the
    following settings to build the package:

    --with-foomatic
    --with-ghostscript
    --with-user-guide
    --with-samples
    --with-escputil

    We suggest the following packaging:

    * A Gutenprint core package should contain the following.  You may
      wish to install the user's guide only in certain formats.

      /usr/lib/libgutenprint.so.2.x.y (the core shared library)
      /usr/bin/escputil (Epson Stylus utility)
      /usr/bin/ijsgutenprint.5.0 (Gutenprint Ghostscript IJS plug-in driver)
      /usr/share/gutenprint/doc/html (HTML documentation)
      /usr/share/gutenprint/doc/users-guide.pdf
      /usr/share/gutenprint/doc/users-guide.ps
      /usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/gutenprint.mo

    * A gutenprint-devel package (for developers) should contain the
      following.  Again, you may wish to install the programmer's
      manual only in certain formats.

      /usr/include/gutenprint
      /usr/bin/gutenprint-config
      /usr/share/gutenprint/doc/manual-html
      /usr/share/gutenprint/doc/gutenprint.ps
      /usr/share/aclocal/gutenprint.m4
      /usr/lib/libgutenprint.a
      /usr/lib/libgutenprint.so

      You may wish to include the test pattern generator source and
      the sample test pattern in this package, and you may wish to
      include test patterns of your own.  You may also wish to include
      the various unprint programs and the parse-* scripts from the
      test directory, although these are typically of more use to
      developers of the Gutenprint package per se than developers of
      applications layered on Gutenprint.  However, the test programs
      have received less testing than the others, and are known to
      have some limitations that are not documented.

    * A gutenprint-extras package should contain

      /usr/share/gutenprint/samples

      You may wish to include the test pattern generator and the
      sample test pattern from src/testpattern if you don't include it
      in the developer package; test/unprint; test/pcl-unprint;
      test/bjc-unprint; test/parse-escp2; and test/parse-bjc in this
      package.

    * Ghostscript requires GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or above, or ESP
      Ghostscript 7.05 or above.

    * CUPS packages should include the gutenprint PPD's in
      /usr/share/cups/model, and the following utilities:

      + "epson" and "canon" belong in /usr/lib/cups/backend.

      + "rastertogutenprint-5.0", "commandtoepson", and
	"commandtocanon" belong in /usr/lib/cups/filter.

      + "cups-calibrate" belongs in /usr/bin.

      + "command.types" belongs in /etc/cups.

      + "calibrate.ppm" belongs in /usr/share/cups.

      The PPD's packaged with gutenprint are rather bulky, about 1 MB
      for each language installed.  At present, twelve language
      translations are installed, in addition to the US English
      defaults: GB English, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, French,
      Polish, Slovakian, Greek, Spanish, Dutch, German, and
      Portuguese.  You may wish to install these selectively.

      Please see KNOWN BUILD ISSUES above for more discussion about
      build issues related to the PPD files.

    * A gutenprint-foomatic package, containing the
      src/foomatic/foomatic-db/gutenprint*/ directories, should be 
      provided to allow people who wish to use foomatic to install the
      corresponding data files. The packaging should arrange to call
      "foomatic-kitload" (or the equivalent) on this tree when it is
      installed.

      An alternative option is to install pregenerated PPD files,
      which may be created with foomatic-compiledb.

    * Please read the release notes carefully!

    * Distributors (UNIX vendors and Linux distributors) should
      subscribe to the gimp-print-devel@sourceforge.net mailing list
      to monitor development activities.  When reporting a problem
      related to building the package for distribution, please
      identify yourself as such.  The Gutenprint package is primarily
      an infrastructure package, rather than an end-user application,
      and as such we particularly want to fix any problems that
      interfere with building and distribution of this package on any
      POSIX-compliant operating system.
