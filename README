INTRODUCTION

    This is Gimp-Print version 4.2.2, a stable release in the 4.2
    series.  Gimp-Print is a suite of printer drivers that may be used
    with most common UNIX print spooling systems, including CUPS, lpr,
    LPRng, or others.  These drivers provide printing quality for
    UNIX/Linux in many cases equal to or better than proprietary
    vendor-supplied drivers, and can be used for many of the most
    demanding printing tasks.  A complete list of supported printers
    may be found in the NEWS file.

    Gimp-Print 4.2.2 is upwardly compatible with other releases of G

    Gimp-Print also includes a plug-in for the GIMP image editor.
    This plug-in is also distributed with the GIMP.

    Please read this README, and the NEWS file carefully!  Many things
    have changed from previous releases.  The package is quite
    different in many ways from Gimp-Print 4.0, and you should read
    these instructions carefully.

    A user's manual exists in doc/users_guide; it is normally
    installed in PDF and HTML form in /usr/local/share/gimp-print/doc.
    This manual covers setup and use of the GIMP Print plug-in and the
    CUPS driver.

    We urge all distributors of this package to read the PACKAGING and
    KNOWN BUILD ISSUES section below.


BASIC INSTALLATION

    We recommend that Macintosh OS X (10.2 or later; this package will
    not work with any 10.0 or 10.1 release) users download the
    precompiled installer package from
    http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net rather than attempt to build
    this package from source, as using the installer is much simpler.
    We further recommend that Macintosh OS X users install ESP
    GhostScript, to permit printing from applications (such as most
    Adobe applications) that generate PostScript rather than PDF
    output.  Directions for that are also available at
    http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net.

    Gimp-Print includes the following primary components:

      - The core driver, libgimpprint.so
      - A user's manual
      - A Print plug-in for the GIMP
      - A CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) driver
      - A standard Ghostscript driver, `stp'
      - An IJS-based Ghostscript driver
      - Support for the Foomatic spooler configuration system
      - A utility to administer Epson printers, escputil

    By default, Gimp-Print builds the Print plugin for the GIMP, the
    user's manual, and a utility to perform head cleaning, nozzle
    alignment, and other tasks on EPSON Stylus inkjet printers, named
    "escputil".  Directions for building other components are listed
    below.

    Please check our web site at http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net for
    details about what is and is not supported.

    Please report any problems to gimp-print-devel@sourceforge.net.

    In general, to build Gimp-Print, you run the following commands:

    ./configure [options]
    make
    make install

    If you do not have the GIMP installed (or if you have only the
    user package installed, and not the development package that most
    distributions include separately), the attempt to run configure
    will fail.  To build other components (such as the IJS or CUPS
    drivers) without the GIMP being present, you must use the
    --without-gimp option to configure.

    Note: This package requires the use of GNU Make to compile.  On
    systems with both GNU make and another make installed, GNU make
    may be named `gmake' or `gnumake'.  BSD users in particular will
    need to use 'gmake'.


THE GIMP

    Gimp-Print may be used as a plug-in for the GIMP, providing the
    ability to print images.  Gimp-print 4.2 requires the GIMP 1.2; it
    is not currently compatible with the GIMP 1.3.

    To build and install the Gimp Print plug-in:

    ./configure [--with-gimp]
    make
    make install

    You may optionally specify --with-gimp if you wish to be explicit
    about building the Gimp Print plugin; --with-gimp is implied if
    `configure' detects that the GIMP is installed, so you do not
    actually need to specify it.

    This installs the GIMP Print plugin in your system plug-in
    directory.  If you wish to install it in your personal plugin
    directory, you may use

    ./configure --enable-user-install

    If you have installed the Gimp as a precompiled package
    (e. g. from an RPM), you will need to install the gimp-devel
    (sometimes called gimp-developer, or something similar) package as
    well as the gimp package.  The gimp package as supplied in most
    distributions only contains what's needed to run the Gimp, not the
    additional files needed to build GIMP-based applications and
    plugins such as the Print plugin.  On some systems, you will also
    need to install gtk-devel and glib-devel packages as well.

    If you have installed the Gimp from source on Linux: after running
    make install, you must run ldconfig as root before attempting to
    build this plugin.


CUPS

    Gimp-print may be used as a driver under CUPS (Common UNIX
    Printing System), if your system uses that spooler.  Full
    description of CUPS is beyond the scope of this README file; full
    information may be found at http://www.cups.org.  Gimp-print 4.2
    requires CUPS 1.1.9 or higher.  We recommend use of 1.1.14 or
    above; that release of CUPS features better internationalization
    and fixes some important bugs.

    This package includes a CUPS driver that may be built, allowing
    use of this software for general printing purposes.  To build and
    install the CUPS driver, you must run:

    ./configure --with-cups
    make
    make install
    /etc/software/init.d/cups restart

    The last command varies with your operating system; the purpose is
    to restart the CUPS server (daemon) so that it sees the newly
    installed driver.  It is typically /etc/init.d/cups,
    /etc/rc.d/cups, or even /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups.  Your system may
    have a different way to restart the CUPS server.  OS X uses the
    following command:

    sudo /System/Library/StartupItems/PrintingServices/PrintingServices.sh restart
  
    NOTE for Linux (at least) users: If you are using CUPS 1.1.11 or
    higher, and you have a USB-connected printer, you must have a
    printer connected to each USB port that you plan to use and
    powered on when you restart CUPS.  If you do not do so, you will
    not be able to perform the following step (reinstalling the
    printer), as described below.

    Following this, you must reinstall any printers that you are using
    Gimp-Print PPD's with.  Such printers may be identified in any
    CUPS front end (e. g. KUPS, or via the web interface) because they
    look something like this:

		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX, CUPS+GIMP-print v4.2.2(en)

    If the version number (in this case, 4.2.2) does not match
    the version of Gimp-Print that you are installing, you must use
    Modify Printer to force the new PPD file to get installed.
    Failure to do so may lead to incorrect output and/or other errors!

    Starting with CUPS 1.1.11, you cannot choose an AppSocket
    connection and enter "usb:/dev/usblp0" or the like as the URI; you
    will get a "client-error-not-possible" error at the end of the
    installation process, and you will have a message like the
    following in your CUPS error log (typically
    /var/log/cups/error_log):

E [21/Nov/2001:17:59:07 +0500] add_printer: bad device-uri attribute 'usb:/dev/usblp0'!

    If the printer was turned on correctly, you will be given a choice
    of a USB connection in the Device dialog.

    You may also have problems if you have a .lpoptions file that has
    old options set.  If you have problems printing, please remove any
    existing .lpoptions file in your home directory and try printing
    again.

    This package normally builds translated versions of the PPD
    files.  This provides PPD files translated into the languages that
    this package supports.  However, the translation process does not
    work correctly on all systems; in particular, many BSD systems are
    known to simply build multiple copies of the English PPD files.
    If your system does not build these files correctly, which will be
    apparent when you use a CUPS front end to select a PPD file and
    you see something like this:

		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX, CUPS+GIMP-print v4.2.2(en)
		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX, CUPS+GIMP-print v4.2.2(en)
		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX, CUPS+GIMP-print v4.2.2(en)

    rather than this:

		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX, CUPS+GIMP-print v4.2.2(en)
		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX, CUPS+GIMP-print v4.2.2(sv)
		    EPSON Stylus Photo EX, CUPS+GIMP-print v4.2.2(fr)

    you may wish to turn off the translation of PPD files:

    ./configure --with-cups --without-translated-ppds

    You may also wish to do this to greatly reduce the number of PPD
    files installed on your system, as the number of translations is
    large and growing.

    The PPD files associated with this driver are for Level 2
    PostScript.  CUPS implements most level 3 PostScript, but there
    are a few constructs that are not implemented.  For this reason,
    we have chosen to define a LanguageLevel of 2 rather than 3.
    PostScript level 3 files are smaller in some cases, and can
    produce smoother gradients, but few applications generate Level 3
    PostScript.  If you would like to use level 3 PostScript, you may
    do

    ./configure --with-cups --enable-cups-level3-ppds

    Unless you fully understand what you are doing, we recommend not
    doing this.

    If you do not wish to build the Gimp Print plugin, you must run

    ./configure --with-cups --without-gimp

    If you have installed CUPS as a precompiled package (e. g. it's
    the standard printing system that your distribution uses), you may
    need to install a separate development package (typically called
    "cups-devel" or "cups-developer").  The CUPS package typically
    installed by most distributions only contains the components
    needed to run CUPS, not those required to build additional CUPS
    drivers.

    We recommend that all users who wish to use this package for
    general purpose printing install either CUPS or use Foomatic with
    the IJS driver (both described below) and use that as their
    printing system, rather than the traditional lpd or lp systems.
    It is much simpler to manage than lpd, and provides an excellent
    web-based interface for both administration and use.  Please visit
    http://www.cups.org for information on downloading and installing
    CUPS.


FOOMATIC

    Gimp-Print includes support for the Foomatic meta-driver package.
    This requires the foomatic-xml distribution.  Foomatic is
    available from http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html.  It is
    also available in Debian unstable.  For best results, use the
    version in cvs.  The first version of Foomatic (the one used with
    Gimp-Print 4.0) is not compatible with Gimp-Print 4.2.  Note that
    the Foomatic driver is named `stp' in Gimp-Print 4.0; in
    Gimp-Print 4.2 it is named `gimp-print' for the Ghostscript
    ("stp") driver and "gimp-print-ijs" for the IJS driver. The data
    for the Gimp-Print 4.0 driver is not compatible with the 4.2
    driver.

    To verify that you have an appropriate version of Foomatic, please
    run

    foomatic-kitload

    or

    /usr/local/sbin/foomatic-kitload (if /usr/local/sbin is not on your PATH).

    If you don't have Foomatic installed, or the version that is
    installed is too old, please download the Foomatic package from
    http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/foomatic/foomatic-current.tar.gz
    following the instructions in that package.

    After Foomatic is installed, build the Foomatic data as follows:

    ./configure --with-foomatic
    make
    make install

    for obtaining the Foomatic data only for the Ghostscript ("stp")
    driver or

    ./configure --with-ijs --with-foomatic
    make
    make install

    for obtaining the Foomatic data for both the Ghostscript ("stp")
    driver and the IJS driver (note that this also build the IJS
    interface itself, so you have to follow the instructions in
    src/ghost/README, too).

    The "make install" step will add the necessary data to your
    Foomatic installation.  It must be run as root.  It will fail if
    Foomatic is not installed or your Foomatic is too old.  Now you
    can either set up a queue for your printer with
    "foomatic-configure" (see USAGE file in the Foomatic package) or
    generate the printer description file for your spooler (with 
    "foomatic-datafile") and configure your printer as described on
    the spooler-specific web pages of linuxprinting.org.

    Note that it almost never makes sense to build the Foomatic driver
    without also building the Ghostscript driver or the IJS driver, 
    even if Foomatic is to be used with CUPS (CUPS-O-Matic).  Please 
    read the instructions below in the GHOSTSCRIPT section.

    If you do not wish to build the Gimp Print plugin, you must run

    ./configure --with-foomatic --without-gimp

    or

    ./configure --with-ijs --with-foomatic --without-gimp

    Please visit http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html for more
    information on Foomatic.

    Foomatic provides an alternate interface to CUPS, in addition to
    an interface to LPD, LPRng, GNUlpr, PDQ, and PPR.


GHOSTSCRIPT

    Gimp-Print 4.2 includes a Ghostscript driver that may be built,
    allowing use of this software for general printing purposes.  This
    package requires GNU Ghostscript 5.10, 5.50, 6.51, or 6.52.  There
    is a simpler build procedure for GNU Ghostscript 6.53 and 7.05,
    and for ESP Ghostscript 7.05.  In particular, versions of
    Ghostscript that are not licensed under the GNU General Public
    License (GPL) are not supported, and this driver may not be
    distributed with such a version.  If you wish to use Gimp-Print
    with AFPL Ghostscript, you may do so via the IJS-based driver,
    described below.

    Please read src/ghost/README for more information, including how
    to build and install it, and available options; the build
    procedure here merely creates the necessary source files that you
    must add to your Ghostscript source.  The directions vary for
    different versions of Ghostscript.

    We *strongly* recommend that end users not attempt to use this
    driver directly.  The available options are very complex, and the
    standard printer configuration tools (such as apsfilter and
    magicfilter) are not designed for drivers such as Gimp-print, and
    do not provide a convenient interface to the driver's
    capabilities.  We recommend that end users either install CUPS, as
    described above, or use Foomatic to configure printer queues.
    CUPS is very easy to install, configure, and use, and is the
    recommended solution.

    Note that many of the options to the Ghostscript driver are
    incompatible with the options used prior to release 4.2.0.
    Please read src/ghost/README for information on the current
    options.

    This driver will not be developed beyond the 4.2 release series.
    It will be replaced by the IJS driver, described below.


IJS

    Gimp-Print includes an IJS-based Ghostscript driver.  As
    paraphrased from the Ghostscript documentation, IJS is a
    relatively new initiative to improve the quality and ease of use
    of inkjet printing with Ghostscript.  Using IJS, one can add new
    drivers, or upgrade existing ones, without recompiling
    Ghostscript.  IJS drivers run as separate processes that
    communicate with Ghostscript via an IPC channel.  As the basic IJS
    implementation is licensed compatibly with the GPL, and as the
    driver runs in a separate process from Ghostscript itself, the IJS
    driver may be used with AFPL Ghostscript (7.04 and above).

    The basic way to build the IJS driver is

    ./configure --with-ijs [--without-gimp]
    make
    make install

    You must have the IJS libraries installed for this to work.
    Instructions for that are included with GNU Ghostscript 6.53 and
    beyond, and AFPL Ghostscript 7.04 and beyond.

    Detailed instructions for building and using the IJS driver is
    described in src/ghost/README.

ALERT: Hollywood Exports Technology Ban Overseas Despite US Abuse

  EFF Calls on Public to Intervene in Treaty Process

    Electronic Frontier Foundation ACTION ALERT

    (Issued: August 16, 2001 / Deadline: August 22, 2001)

    Introduction:

   [Para una versiÅÛn espaÅÒol de esta alarma, que puede ser distribuida
   libremente, vaya a este URL (For a Spanish version of this alert,
   which may be freely distributed, go to this URL):

   While Russian graduate student Dmitry Sklyarov potentially faces five
   years in prison under the first criminal prosecution of a
   controversial new US law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
   passed at the request of Hollywood in 1998, its backers are now busily
   exporting overseas its dangerous legal theories of excessive copyright
   protection at the price of civil liberties. Worldwide public
   intervention is immediately necessary to restore freedom of speech as
   a value promoted by free societies.

   The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) treaty process, which is
   under executive power, works to establish trade agreements between 34
   countries in the Western hemisphere including the US. FTAA
   nation-signatories pass legislation in each of their national forums
   that conforms with the treaty's principles. Currently the group is
   negotiating language to include in an international treaty between the
   34 countries that deals with enacting new copyright rules, among other
   issues. The FTAA organization is considering treaty language that
   mandates nations pass anti-circumvention provisions similar to the
   DMCA, except the FTAA treaty grants even greater control to publishers
   than the DMCA.

   The public must intervene to express disapproval of the FTAA's
   proposed anti-circumvention measures in order to correct this trend in
   copyright law. FTAA is currently accepting public feedback on the
   proposed treaty language until August 22. Contact the U.S. Trade
   Representative (or your country's representative) and urge the removal
   of the anti-circumvention measures from incorporation into the final
   FTAA treaty. Already existing theories of liability under US copyright
   law adequately protect the legitimate interests of copyright holders
   without the need to impose anti-technology restrictions on the entire
   public. Rather than adopt even more draconian measures that ban
   socially beneficial technologies in a fantasy of protecting
   copyrights, such as the proposed anti-circumvention measures to FTAA
   attempts, foreign countries should learn from the disastrous US
   experience with the DMCA. They should wisely steer away from such
   over-reaching measures.

    What YOU Can Do:

   EFF calls upon the citizens of the 34 countries affected by this
   treaty, including the US, to submit comments by August 20 (22 at the
   latest) urging the group to remove the provisions from the treaty that
   outlaw the act of circumvention and forbid providing tools for
   circumvention of technological protection measures restricting use of
   copyrighted works. These measures violate the U.S. Constitution's
   guarantee of freedom of speech under the First Amendment, similar
   guarantees in other national constitutions and laws and in the UN
   Universal Declaration of Human Rights, since such tools are necessary
   to exercise lawful uses, including fair use. While protecting
   copyright is important, passing measures that also censor much lawful
   speech goes too far, without ever achieving its objective. The next
   meeting of the FTAA Negotiating Group on Intellectual Property Rights
   is Aug. 22 in Panama, and public comments will be most effective if
   received before this date. This means it should be mailed by Aug. 18
   at the latest, in the US, and even sooner from other countries.
   (Unfortunately, the FTAA site does not provide mechanisms for
   Web-submitted comments, or addresses for e-mailed comments.)

   Comments, to be received by the FTAA organization by August 20, should
   be submitted to: 

   Gloria Blue, Executive Secretary, Trade Policy Staff Committee
   Attn: FTAA Draft Text Release
   Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
   1724 F. St., NW, Fifth Floor
   Washington DC 20508 USA

   Non-US writers should also send a copy to their own country's
   intellectual property government officials; list available at:
     http://www.sice.oas.org/int_prop/ip_dir.asp

      Sample Letter

   This is just an example. It will be most effective if you send
   something similar but in your own words

     Dear Ms. Blue, Trade Policy Staff Committee, and Negotiating Group
     on Intellectual Property Rights:

     I write to express my grave concern regarding the draft FTAA
     treaty's extreme intellectual property provisions.

     These measures, based on the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act
     (DMCA) give far too much power to publishers, at the expense of
     indivdiuals' rights. The DMCA itself is already under legal
     challenge in the US, has gravely chilled scientists' and computer
     security researchers' freedom of expression around the world for
     fear of being prosecuted in the US, and resulted in the arrest of a
     Russian programmer. The FTAA provisions, which serve no one but
     American corporate copyright interests, are even more overbroad
     than those of the DMCA.

     These provisions would require signatory nations to pass new
     DMCA-style laws that ban, with few or no exceptions, software and
     other tools that allow copy prevention technologies to be bypassed.
     This would violate the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom of
     speech under the First Amendment, and similar guarantees in other
     national constitutions and laws and in the UN Universal Declaration
     of Human Rights, since such tools are necessary to exercise lawful
     uses, including fair use, reverse engineering, computer security
     research and many others.

     I urge you to remove these controversial and anti-freedom
     provisions from the FTAA treaty language. The DMCA is already an
     international debacle. Its flaws - and worse - should not be
     exported and forced on other countries.

     Sincerely,
     [Your full name]
     [Your address]

   Non-US writers should mention their own country's constitution and/or
   laws protecting freedom of expression, of coruse.

    Background:

   Much like the DMCA, the current draft of the FTAA agreement forbids
   the act of circumventing a "technological protection measure" that
   controls the use of a copyrighted work. It also bans making or
   providing tools that could help another to use a copyrighted work.
   Unlike the DMCA, however, the language currently proposed for the FTAA
   treaty doesn't include even a single exemption that would permit
   activities like lawful reverse engineering, protecting privacy, fair
   use rights, encryption research, and countless other reasons a person
   might need to override the publisher's controls. (And the DMCA only
   includes a few very narrow exemptions to the general ban on
   circumvention, but they have so far proven completely useless to
   everyone who has attempted to rely on them.)

   Even though copyright law gives individuals rights such as fair use,
   the DMCA and FTAA's proposed anti-circumvention provisions outlaw all
   tools that are necessary to exercise those rights, effectively killing
   fair use in the digital age. These measures ensure works are prevented
   from taking their place in the public domain, denying the public what
   rightfully belongs to it under the law. The guarantees of free
   expression under the First Amendment, other constitutions & laws in
   other countries, and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights, rightly prevent publishers from having complete control over
   the way in which copyrighted works can be used. But the DMCA and its
   counterpart in the FTAA treaty ignore this principle and would grant
   publishing companies the power to turn individual rights into "product
   features" that can be disabled at the whim of the publisher.

   Since its passage, the DMCA has thus far been used to: censor a
   journalist reporting on a controversial software program; attempt to
   squelch the research of a Princeton professor who discovered the
   vulnerabilities of the music industry's favored technology; and arrest
   a foreign computer programmer for developing software that allows
   lawful purchasers of electronic books to view them in ways not
   supported by a competitor's viewing software. Because it wishes to
   consistently abuse these powers throughout the world, rather than
   merely in the United States, Hollywood and the rest of the copyright
   industry are now attempting to export this legal regime throughout the
   world.

   It is truly ironic that the United States, once the beacon for
   promoting the principles of freedom of expression, is now
   systematically infecting other countries with this dangerous public
   policy choice that will restrict more speech than any law before it.
   FTAA's anti-circumvention provisions represent US imperialism at its
   worst. They seek to impose restrictive laws on both the US and other
   countries, in order to prevent established US businesses from facing
   both domestic and foreign competition. These competitors would offer
   the public much better deals than these businesses wish to offer,
   which is why the small number of companies that control music, movie
   and book distribution seek to have these competitors outlawed. The
   anti-circumvention provisions' terrible effects on freedom of speech,
   scientific advancement, and actual computer security, as well as on
   public libraries and access to knowledge, are merely "incidental"
   damage, suffered by society for the benefit of these businesses.

            Scientists Support Professor's Copyright Law Challenge

Electronic Frontier Foundation Exposes "Chilling Effect"

   Trenton, NJ - Seventeen of the world's top scientists today supported
   Princeton University Professor Edward Felten and his research team's
   challenge to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) on free
   speech grounds. Prominent academics, cryptographers, software
   programmers, and scientific conference organizers explained to a
   federal court the stifling effects of the DMCA on scientific research
   and freedom of expression.

   The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) represents the research team
   in a lawsuit filed June 6 asking a federal judge to declare that the
   scientists have a First Amendment right to publish their research both
   at the USENIX Conference in Washington, DC, and elsewhere. USENIX,
   fearful of threats that had been made against the organizers of the
   prior conference, has joined the suit.

   In his latest declaration to the court, Professor Felten explained, "I
   understand that Defendants advocate an interpretation of the DMCA that
   would outlaw analysis of systems that might be used to control the use
   of copyrighted materials.... [S]uch an interpretation would
   effectively prevent analysis of critical systems, and so would have a
   disastrous effect on education, research, and practice in computer
   security."

   He further commented, "Not only in computer science, but also across
   all scientific fields, skeptical analysis of technical claims made by
   others, and the presentation of detailed evidence to support such
   analysis, is the heart of the scientific method. To outlaw such
   analysis is to outlaw the scientific method itself."

   The case arose after scientists from Princeton University, Rice
   University, and Xerox tried to publish research that reveals flaws in
   the recording industry's control systems for digital music at an April
   2001 conference. The recording industry claimed that a 1998 law called
   the DMCA prohibited the presentation of the research paper. In a
   series of e-mails and conference calls to the researchers, their
   universities, and conference organizers, recording industry attorneys
   intimidated the researchers into withdrawing their paper from the
   April conference. Hours after the paper was withdrawn, representatives
   of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) issued a press
   release claiming that they had never intended to prevent scientific
   speech.

   Last month, the RIAA asked the court to dismiss the current lawsuit
   after sending a letter to the court stating that it would allow the
   conference to go forward, so no case or controversy exists for the
   court to decide. The EFF legal filing today rebuts that claim and
   reveals the chilling effect felt throughout the scientific community
   since Congress passed the DMCA and the recording industry started
   threatening researchers.

   In legal declarations supporting the researchers, scientists worldwide
   expressed concern about traveling to the United States, where the FBI
   has already arrested and jailed a programmer for allegedly writing
   software or conducting research that could help someone use a
   copyrighted work in ways disallowed by the publisher.

   Niels Ferguson, a prominent Dutch cryptographer who recently
   discovered major flaws in a commercial high-definition video system,
   told the court, "Despite the fact that I performed all the work in
   Amsterdam, I could face arrest if I visit the US after my research had
   found its way into the jurisdiction. My research is silenced since I
   cannot talk about my scientific results to my colleagues and peers, as
   is now the case since the DMCA became law in the US. Scientific
   freedom is not only threatened under this law, it is demonstrably
   curtailed."

   The DMCA prohibits providing information that other people may use to
   circumvent the technological protection measures placed on digital
   files. In this case, the recording industry developed watermark
   technologies to help control how consumers can use digital music.

   Professor Felten's team discovered that it was easy to circumvent the
   technologies.

   "The recording industry has done untold damage by their threats to
   Felten and the other researchers, their universities, and the
   conference organizers. The resulting chilling effect on the broader
   scientific community continues unabated," said Robin Gross,
   intellectual property attorney for EFF. "We on the Felten legal team
   will work to ensure that industry can no longer use the DMCA to
   threaten freedom of speech and scientific progress."

   results, Aug. 15, 2001, USENIX Security Conference, Washington DC, is
