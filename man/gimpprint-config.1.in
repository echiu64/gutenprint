.TH GIMP-PRINT 1 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GIMPPRINT_VERSION@" "Gimp-Print Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
gimpprint-config - script to get information about the installed version of
gimpprint
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gimpprint-config
[\-\-prefix\fI[=dir]\fP] [\-\-exec\-prefix\fI[=dir]\fP] [\-\-version] [\-\-libs] [\-\-cflags]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBgimpprint-config\fP is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and
linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use
\fIGimp-Print\fP. It is also used internally to the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf
that are included with \fIGimp-Print\fP (\fIAM_PATH_GIMPPRINT\fP).
.PP
.B gimpprint-config is OBSOLETE!
.B gimpprint-config
is replaced by \fBpkg-config\fP.  Use
.IP
.B pkg-config --cflags gimpprint
.br
.B pkg-config --libs gimpprint
.br
.B pkg-config --version gimpprint
.PP
instead.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBgimpprint-config\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of \fIGimp-Print\fP on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a \fIGimp-Print\fP program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a \fIGimp-Print\fP program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-prefix=\fIprefix\fP
If specified, use \fIprefix\fP instead of the installation prefix that
\fIGimp-Print\fP was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix if
\-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-exec\-prefix=\fIprefix\fP
If specified, use \fIprefix\fP instead of the installation exec prefix that
\fIGimp-Print\fP was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
